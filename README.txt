This project aims to make it easy to build collaborative editing applications
for structured data stores. It leverages a number of open source technologies
including Android, SQLite, Avro, Git and SmartSockets. It provides a system
for definition of a schema at runtime and instantiates a database and
user interface for adding and editing records in that database.
